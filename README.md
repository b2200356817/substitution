# Optimizing In-Game Decisions: A Data-Driven Approach to Soccer Substitutions

This project explores the impact of player substitutions on soccer match outcomes, aiming to develop a machine learning-based substitution recommender. By analyzing substitution patterns and their effects on team performance, the goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing in-game decisions.

Future developments (in progress / postponed) will include:
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Exploratory analysis of substitution patterns
* Machine learning models for optimizing substitution strategies

Currently, the repository contains the web scraper for collecting substitution data, which serves as the foundation for further analysis. Additional components will be published once the project reaches a more complete stage.
